        <p>The road bikes of today have come a long way from the pedal-free, all-wooddraisines and velocipedes of the 1820s. For years only the elite used bikes, but as technology improved and mass production techniques began to take hold, bikes eventually became a widely used form of transportation all over the world. With this widespread use, all sorts of designs for new bikes began to find their way into the marketplace. This included pedal-powered bikes with solid-rubber tires set on various combinations of three wheels, four wheels, large wheels and small wheels.</p>

        <p>In 1870 the first all-metal, high-wheel penny-farthing bicycle appeared on the scene. However, sitting four to five feet off the ground and hitting a rock in the road often presented some pretty obvious safety concerns.</p>

        <p>Road racing in its modern form originated in the late 19th century. It began as an organized sport in 1868. The sport was popular in the western European countries of France, Spain, Belgium, and Italy, and some of those earliest road bicycle races remain among the sport's biggest events. These early races include Liège–Bastogne–Liège (established 1892), Paris–Roubaix (1896), the Tour de France (1903), the Milan–San Remo and Giro di Lombardia (1905), the Giro d'Italia (1909), the Volta a Catalunya (1911), and the Tour of Flanders (1913).</p>

        <p>Historically, the most competitive and devoted countries since the beginning of 20th century were Belgium, France and Italy, then road cycling spread in Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland after World War II. However, as the sport grows in popularity through globalization, countries such as Kazakhstan, Australia, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland and the United States continue to produce world-class cyclists.</p>

        <p>The first women’s road championships were held in France in 1951. A women’s road race discipline was added to the UCI Road World Championships at the 31st edition of the World Championships in 1958 in Reims.</p>

        <p>With the advent of computer design technology in the twenty-first century, along with increased knowledge about aerodynamics, materials science and efficient manufacturing practices, bikes are getting lighter, stronger and, consequently, more expensive.</p>

        The three Grand Tours, the Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a Espana are amongst the longest and most famous cycling events on the planet. In road bicycle racing, a Grand Tour is one of the three major European professional cycling stage races: Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a España. Collectively they are termed the Grand Tours, and all three races are similar in format being three-week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the UCI regulations: more points for the UCI World Tour are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races, and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days, winning one is a major achievement for any professional cyclist.</p>

        <p>The five greatest one-day (classic) cycling events on the planet are known as the Monuments of Cycling. These races—Milan-San Remo, the Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, and the Tour of Lombardy—carry the distinction of being called the Monuments. They are so named because they began prior to World War I; the youngest of the events, the Tour of Flanders, was first run in 1913. The roads they travel were used during the World Wars and now the courses are lined with memorials to the war dead.</p>

    <p>“The cyclist is a man half made of flesh and half of steel that only our century of science and iron could have spawned.” — Louis Baudry de Saunier, 19th-century French author</p>
    <p>“When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.” — Arthur Conan Doyle, British author</p>
