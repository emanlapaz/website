Hello! My website is about the 2021 cycling season(Grand Tours and Classics). Im a cyclist and an avid road race cyling fan

In my home page I've included a bit of history on how road cyling races has begun. Ive also introduced the Grand tours and the Monument Classics. Each pages has its own colour theme and event. I have included a gallery as well a the contact page.

I made a Grid with 3 columns and 4 rows for the main content.

The Navigation bar is fixed on the top position for ease of access to the other pages. I have utilized a flexbox with the navigation bar. The buttons on the page will be highlighted based on the color of the page.

I have included photos and videos embedded from youtube using <iframe>. I have also used the <figure><figurecaption> for some of the images. 

I have a right and left sidebar for the the website links and logo images.Right sidebar changed to sidebar.njk file

Ive also made a footer element as a disclaimer statement. Footer change to .njk file

In my contact me page, I have included a bit about me and a few videos and link on some of my personal cycling events that I had joined before.

These are my references:
